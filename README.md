# KRATOS: Fine-grain Access Control for Smart Home
KRATOS is a multi-user multi-device-aware access control system designed for the smart home systems. KRATOS introduces a formal policy language that allows users to define different policies for smart home devices, specifying their needs. It also implements a policy negotiation algorithm that automatically solves and optimizes the conflicting policy requests from multiple users by leveraging user roles and priorities. Lastly, Kratos governs different policies for different users, reviewing the results of the policy negotiation and enforcing the negotiation results over the smart home devices and apps.
